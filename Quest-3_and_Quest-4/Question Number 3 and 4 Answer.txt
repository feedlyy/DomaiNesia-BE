3. Plain PHP to Symphony Framework
- What things should we consider before migration?
1. Migrating Databases
2. Data querying
3. Time estimation for learning new Framework
4. Resources (Programmer)
5. Authentication
6. MVC concept, a lot of frameworks using the MVC concept
- How do we do plan the transition?
Because I have never been doing the transition, in my opinion, this will be my plan before the transition:
1. Make sure time estimation for the transition, this very important because migration to framework needs a lot of considerations
2. Resources/programmer that we had, if we had a programmer that already know or have been using the framework it makes the transition easier
3. Database migration, we must make sure the framework we choose support the previous database that we using
That's my plan before doing the transition.

4. why do you choose to become a backend developer? What parts make you passionate? 
I choose to become a backend developer because I'm weak at design. Solving a problem it's way more challenging than design something. I'm maybe not a fast learner, but when I came up with a problem and I know how to do it but it ain't solve yet it makes me more excited.
